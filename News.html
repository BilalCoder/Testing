						<h2>New York City's best rooftop bars</h2>
				</a>
				<p>There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's streets, especially in the
					summertime, when humidity levels soar and the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves.
					"Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city,
					inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm
					behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the
					streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all
					the while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be
					intoxicating," says Chung.</p>

					<h2>Meet Gaggan Anand, the 'world's best' Indian chef</h2>
			</a>
			<p>Gaggan was sitting in a Singapore ballroom attending the Asia's 50 Best Restaurant Awards, waiting in
				agony to find out whether his eponymous Bangkok-based restaurant could hold onto the number three spot
				it grabbed last year "As they got to five, then four, and my name hadn't been called, I thought 'that
				means I'm three again ... at least we matched our success, at least we're on the right track," he
				says."When they were about to call number two and I still hadn't been called up, I thought 'If I'm
				number one, I'll try not to cry.'</p>

				<h2>The best things to do and see in Newport</h2>
		</a>
		<p> Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty coastal New England towns got their start in the same place:
			Newport, Rhode Island.The town is best known for being a summer getaway for America's aristocracy during the
			Gilded Age, with wealthy families like the Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors all owning summer homes there
			(they say "cottage," we say "ginormous mansion") and throwing glamorous parties.Although more of the
			luxurious estates are museums than homes these days, Newport hasn't lost its seaside charm -- especially in
			the summer. Here's our guide to the best things to do, eat and explore both indoors and out.</p>

				<h2>Sixteen Dogs Find Forever Homes After Being Rescued</h2>
		</a>
		<p>Just minutes before the Humane Society Shelter in Bangor, Maine closed for the day on Tuesday, they only had
			one lone puppy left who had yet to be adopted. Not to worry however, that puppy too found a great forever
			home, marking the end of an amazing campaign to save some dogs on death row from a high-kill shelter in the
			southern United States.Ada Webb was the lucky person to adopt that final dog. Webb had been in line there
			for quite some time waiting to adopt, hoping to be able to surprise her nine-year-old son with a new,
			four-legged furry family member. </p>
